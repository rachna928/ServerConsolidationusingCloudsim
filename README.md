The rising demand for cloud based applications in recent years and energy consumption by data centres is a concern. This increased demand for energy consumption results in the high rate of carbon emissions on the environment. Many times ineffcient use of resources is the reason for this increased demand for electricity.
To overcome the problem of inefficient resource utilisation and to reduce the energy consumption server consolidation is one solution. Server consolidation is a process in
which the number of active hosts is reduced by turning them into sleep mode which will reduce energy consumption. During Server consolidation algorithms like linear
regression model and bin packing model have been implemented in data centres. In this research, we propose a model which is a combination of the multiple regression
and best fit decreasing bin packing model based on the historical CPU utilization data. The model is designed to ensure the reduction in energy consumption and
the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the energy consumption and the SLA violations using
the Real-time PlanetLab Workload Traces. The proposed method outperforms the local regression algorithm.
